# refactored-garbanzo
This is a capstone project for UW Scala programming certification.

This project will be to build a model for demand forecasting in the logistics/shipping industry backed primarily by a distributed Spark system.

It will use Spark streaming, MLLib, Kafka, MongoDB, Akka/HTTP. It will also use Actors, JSON, Docker. Additional ML libraries may be needed.  A front end component could be built at the end of the project if time allows to display results otherwise it will be provided via REST API or Kafka topic.

The model data will be feed from my companies internal system's data (Expeditors), which I will anonymize before any class demos.
